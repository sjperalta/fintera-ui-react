## 🧭 Part 1: Reading Your Dashboard

When you log in, you aren't just looking at numbers; you're looking at the health of your investment.

### 1. The Progress Bar 📊
Measurements of your journey.
- **What it tells you:** "How much of this land is mine?"
- **The Goal:** 100%. Every payment pushes this bar forward.
- **Color Codes:**
    - 🔵 **Blue:** You are on track.
    - 🟢 **Green:** You generally completed payment schedule (Success!).
    - 🔴 **Red (Indicator):** usually denotes an overdue status or "Mora".

### 2. The Balance ("The Mountain") ⛰️
- **Definition:** The exact amount of money required *today* to walk away with the deed.
- **The Math:** `Original Price - (Down Payment + Principal Payments)`.
- **Note:** Interest is the "cost of time" paid along the way; it doesn't reduce the mountain height, it just pays for the climb.

### 3. The Next Due Date 📅
- **The Deadline:** The day your next maneuver is expected.
- **The Rule:** Pay *before* or *on* this date to keep your record spotless and avoid "Mora".

## 📚 Part 2: Terms You Need to Know

The language of your contract, translated to plain English.

| Term | In Simple Terms | Impact on You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financed Amount** | The money we lent you to buy the lot. | This is the starting line of your debt. |
| **Cuota (Installment)** | Your monthly "subscription" to the loan. | Includes a mix of Capital (Debt) + Interest (Fee). |
| **Interest Rate** | The "Rental Fee" on the money borrowed. | The annual percentage charged on your remaining balance. |
| **Mora (Late Fee)** | The "Penalty Flag". | Charged daily if you miss a deadline. Start paying ON TIME to avoid this! |
| **Ledger (Statement)** | Your official receipt book. | If a payment isn't here, it didn't happen. Always verify this match your bank transfer. |

## 🕹️ Part 3: Your Actions & Effects

You have the wheel. Here is how your moves change the system.

### 💸 Action 1: Making a Regular Payment
*You pay exactly the monthly installment amount.*
- **System Effect:**
    1.  Your status stays **Current** (Green).
    2.  Your "Next Payment Date" jumps forward one month.
    3.  Your Balance decreases slightly (by the capital portion of the payment).

### 🚀 Action 2: Making a Capital Repayment ("Abono")
*You pay EXTRA money on top of your monthly due.*
- **System Effect:**
    1.  **Pure Reduction:** 100% of this extra money attacks the Balance directly. No interest is charged on it.
    2.  **Time Travel:** Because your debt is smaller, the system effectively *deletes* the last few months of your scheduled payments. You finish paying years earlier!
    3.  **Wealth Building:** This is the fastest way to save money on interest.

### 🐢 Action 3: Paying Late
*You pay days after the Due Date.*
- **System Effect:**
    1.  **Mora Trigger:** The system adds a penalty fee to your next bill.
    2.  **Order of Operations:** Your payment will first pay the *Penalty*, then the *Interest*, and only *then* the *Principal*.
    3.  **Result:** You reduce less debt than usual because money was wasted on the penalty. 🛑

- [ ] **Check the Date:** Is your payment due on the 1st, 15th, or 30th?
- [ ] **Save Receipts:** Keep a photo of every transfer until you see it on your Dashboard.
