## 🧭 Part 1: Your Dashboard (Main Display)

When you log in, `The Main Heads-Up Display` shows the financial pulse of your investment.

### 1. The Balance ("The Mountain") ⛰️
Found in the **"Balance" Card**.
*   **What it is:** The exact amount of money required *today* to walk away with the deed.
*   **The Math:** `Original Price - (Down Payment + Principal Payments)`.
*   **Status Indicators:** Look for the small pill status (e.g., `APPROVED`, `PENDING`). This tells you if the system is happy with your latest inputs.
*   **Note:** Interest is the "cost of time" paid along the way; it doesn't reduce the "Mountain" height, it just pays for the climb.

### 2. The Progress Bar 📊
Found in the **Statistics Bar**.
*   **What it tells you:** "How much of this land is mine?"
*   **The Goal:** 100%. Watch this fill from left to right as every payment pushes the bar forward.
*   **Color Codes:**
    *   🔵 **Blue:** You are on track.
    *   🟢 **Green:** You generally completed payment schedule (Success!).
    *   🔴 **Red:** Usually denotes an overdue status or "Mora".

### 3. The Next Due Date 📅
Found in the **"Next Payment" Radar**.
*   **The Deadline:** The day your next maneuver is expected.
*   **The Rule:** Pay *before* or *on* this date to keep your record spotless and avoid "Mora".
*   **The Amount:** The exact amount needed to keep your account "Green" for the upcoming month (`Installment + Overdue Interest`).

## 📚 Part 2: Terms You Need to Know

The language of your contract, translated to plain English.

| Term | In Simple Terms | Impact on You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financed Amount** | The money we lent you to buy the lot. | This is the starting line of your debt. |
| **Cuota (Installment)** | Your monthly "subscription" to the loan. | Includes a mix of Capital (Debt) + Interest (Fee). |
| **Interest Rate** | The "Rental Fee" on the money borrowed. | The annual percentage charged on your remaining balance. |
| **Mora (Late Fee)** | The "Penalty Flag". | Charged daily if you miss a deadline. Start paying ON TIME to avoid this! |
| **Ledger (Statement)** | Your official receipt book. | If a payment isn't here, it didn't happen. Always verify this matches your bank transfer. |

## 🕹️ Part 3: Your Actions & Payments

You have the wheel. Here is how your moves change the system.

### 📸 The Primary Action: Uploading a Receipt
*Found in the `TimelinePaymentCard` component.*

**This is your primary job.** When you make a bank transfer, you must tell the system.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1.  **Scroll** down to the "Payment Timeline" (or use the FAB button on mobile).
2.  **Find** the card with the `PENDING` (Amber) status.
3.  **Click** the **"Upload Receipt"** button (or the Camera icon).
4.  **Select** the photo/screenshot of your bank transfer.
5.  **Confirm:** The system will upload it securely.

> **✨ Magic Moment:** Once uploaded, the status changes to `SUBMITTED`. An admin will review it, and once approved, your Balance drops instantly.

### 💸 Action 1: Making a Regular Payment
*You pay exactly the monthly installment amount.*
*   **System Effect:**
    1.  Your status stays **Current** (Green).
    2.  Your "Next Payment Date" jumps forward one month.
    3.  Your Balance decreases slightly.

### 🚀 Action 2: Making a Capital Repayment ("Abono")
*You pay EXTRA money on top of your monthly due.*
*   **System Effect:**
    1.  **Pure Reduction:** 100% of this extra money attacks the Balance directly. No interest is charged on it.
    2.  **Time Travel:** Because your debt is smaller, the system effectively *deletes* the last few months of your scheduled payments.
    3.  **Wealth Building:** This is the fastest way to save money on interest.

### 🐢 Action 3: Paying Late (Avoid This!)
*You pay days after the Due Date.*
*   **System Effect:**
    1.  **Mora Trigger:** The system adds a penalty catch-up fee to your next bill.
    2.  **Order of Operations:** Your payment pays *Penalty* -> *Interest* -> *Principal*.
    3.  **Result:** You reduce less debt because money was wasted on the penalty. 🛑

## 📅 Part 4: The Time Machine (Timeline)

The list of cards isn't just history; it's a living record of your journey.

*   **Green Dot (Paid):** You're safe. This month is closed.
*   **Amber Dot (Pending):** Money is expected.
*   **Red Dot (Overdue):** Action required immediately. Upload a receipt ASAP.

### 💡 Pro Tip for Mobile Users
Look for the **Floating Action Button (FAB)** (`+` icon) in the bottom right. It opens the "Upload" camera immediately!
