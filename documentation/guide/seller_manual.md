# 🤝 The Dealmaker's Guide
*Managing Inventory, Clients, and Closing Deals in Fintera*

Welcome to the front lines. As a Seller, you are the bridge between the land (Inventory) and the dream (The Client). This manual is your toolkit for navigating the market and managing your portfolio.

## 🗺️ Part 1: The Map Room (Inventory)

Before you can sell, you must know what is available. The **Interactive Map** is your primary tool.

### 1. The Color Code (Status)
The map communicates in three simple colors. Know them by heart:
*   🟢 **Green (Available):** Open for business. You can quote it, reserve it, or sell it right now.
*   🟡 **Amber (Reserved):** "Dibs" called. Another agent (or you) has locked this lot temporarily.
    *   *Tip:* Hover over it to see when the reservation expires. If time runs out, it turns Green again.
*   🔴 **Red (Sold):** Gone. It belongs to a client now.

### 2. The Filters 🔍
Don't just scroll aimlessly. Use the power tools:
*   **Budget Search:** *"Show me lots under $40,000."*
*   **Size Search:** *"I need at least 300m²."*
*   **Block Search:** *"My client wants to be in the new 'Sunset' block."*

## 💬 Part 2: The Pitch (Simulation)

Price is rarely the problem; structure is. Use the **Simulator** to make the numbers work for your client.

### The Levers You Can Pull:
1.  **Down Payment (Prima):** The higher the better. A big starts reduces the monthly load immediately.
2.  **Term (Months):** Stretch it out to lower the monthly payment, or shorten it to save on interest.
3.  **Start Date:** Does the client need a month to gather the funds? Push the start date (but not too far!).

> **🚀 Speed Action:** Once you find the perfect numbers, click **"Generate PDF Quote"**. Send it to the client's WhatsApp in seconds.

## ✍️ Part 3: The Handshake (Closing the Deal)

When the client says "Yes", follow this strict workflow to lock it in.

### Step 1: Reserve (The Lock) 🔐
*   **Action:** Click the Green Lot -> Select "Reserve".
*   **Result:** The lot turns **Amber** globally. You have blocked other agents from snatching it.
*   **Timer:** You now have X days to get the contract signed. Don't waste them.

### Step 2: Customer Creation 👤
*   **New Client:** Create them in the system. Accurate email is critical (it's their login!).
*   **Returning Client:** Simply select them from the list.

### Step 3: Contract Submission 📤
*   **Upload:** Attach the ID, Proof of Address, and Signed Agreement.
*   **Submit:** Send the deal to the Admin.
*   **Result:** The status changes to `Waiting for Approval`.

## 💼 Part 4: The Relationship (Portfolio)

Closing the deal is just Day 1. You are the specific guide for your clients during their journey.

### 1. The Health Bar 🏥
Your Dashboard shows a list of all your active clients. Watch the colors:
*   🟢 **Current:** High five. They are paying on time.
*   🔴 **Overdue:** Danger. Call them. Usually, they just forgot or need help uploading a receipt.

### 2. The "Receipt Assist" 📸
Sometimes a client isn't tech-savvy. You have the power to help:
*   **Action:** If a client sends you their bank slip via WhatsApp, **YOU** can upload it to their portal for them.
*   **Why:** It keeps the Ledger clean and stops the "Mora" penalty from ticking.

## 🏆 Checklist for Top Sellers

- [ ] **Morning Scan:** Check the Map for new releases or expired reservations (lots turning Green).
- [ ] **Portfolio Check:** Look for any Red bars in your client list and reach out before the month ends.
- [ ] **Clean Data:** Ensure your client's email and phone number are correct, or they won't receive payment reminders!
